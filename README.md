The MATLAB code for the repeated auction executed across several replications is the script. Each replication comprises several successive steps, in which buyers place specific bids for items and the two top bids result in getting these items. Firstly, the codes define variables including the number of repetitions, passes, the number of buyers and their valuation. Then, it repeats itself on every replication round, writing random bids, sorting them, calculating buyer profits, and 4
computing social welfare (Charpentier et al. 2021). On each iteration it moves on to the next round while showing profit margins and/or social welfare as part of the results. In the end, it computes the average number value for total gross profit and society well-being across replications. This cyclic analysis shows the auction rate as well as efficiency compared to the other methods.

The MATLAB simulation starts with 10 replications of the 3-round and 3-buyers auction scenarios. Profit for each buyer and the social welfare of the entire community during each round is taken into consideration. In total, the average sum of profits for the experiment is 77.70. However, the average social welfare is 120.00.

This MATLAB code has parameters assigned for the buyer valuations and equilibrium points. Then it repeats these steps for all three bids, and if there is no equilibrium for which no buyer is willing to exceed bid, it goes back to the beginning. Equilibria which accordingly have a social welfare contain them (Hai et al. 2021). It represents the last step and it is given by the average social welfare leveled across all equilibria. The model in the big form articulately emphasizes different types of bidding situations while it gives an even distribution of welfare through quantification of the total welfare gained. It's a digital footprint search of the market state of a person or entity by data analysis and market competitiveness measurement based on auction results and market welfare.

At the Nash equilibrium, firm 1 produces slightly fewer units which is 13/3, firm 2 produces 26/3 units, firm 1's profit is about 166.11 approximately, firm 2 is about 157.78, the consumer surplus depends between 51.89, and the total surplus is approximately 375.78. The consumer surplus (CS) can be calculated as the area that is over the region limit consisting of the demand curve and marginal cost curve of firm 1. This region is integrated from ùëû1 to 0 (Duarte et al. 2023). At the equilibrium, the CS computed to be 51.89. The entire surplus sum is the aggregate of the less profits and surplus generating consumers. On the other hand, at the equilibrium, the TS is approximately 375.78.

# Conclusion 

A business entity can collude with its constituent firms by following two distinct modes. A company can either be an explicit colluder or a tacit colluder. In explicit cooperation, firms if purposely cooperate in order to collude price, restrain production, or market division. This may entail setting up formal deals like on cartels or arrangements in which prices are being jointly set. However, an example of tacit collusion is the firms‚Äô implicit coordination of their conduct without explicit communication, often through the observation of how others react to their moves in the market.
